#DFA that accepts strings that start with one and end with 0
## The formatting is as follows
## first entry MUST be the starting state. Example: starting-p0
## the second entry MUST be the (set) of accepting states. Example: accepting-q0
## if you have more than one accepting state separate them with comma.
## example: accepting-q0,p1,t
## the remaining entries, one per line, are for the transitions
##of the form: fromState-symbol-toState. Example p0-1-q1. 
## if you have an NFA with multiple toState separate them with commas like for the accepting.
## below is a minimal DFA with one state
starting-p0
accepting-p0
p0-0-p0
p0-1-p0
